The Gaming Room

Client and Software Requirements:

Overview The client, The Gaming Room, tasked the development team with devising an expandable software architecture in support of their online Flash-based game called Draw It or Lose It. Thus, the key elements involved developing a single-game application following object-oriented design; utilizing the Singleton pattern to control access to shared data representing the state of a single game; and implementing multi-platform compatibility on Linux, Mac, Windows, and mobile platforms. It needed to have features like high-level security measures, efficient memory and storage management, and scaling up with users. In a nutshell, the requirement was for a robust cross-platform game with a seamless and secure user experience.

Documentation Development:

In developing the documentation, I believe I did particularly well in outlining the system architecture and design constraints. I effectively broke down the application into logical and physical layers, which provided a clear structure for how the components of the system would interact. Besides, the design constraints have been comprehensively addressed-platform independence, latency, security, and scalability-which will guide future development to ensure that all technical requirements are met. The domain model, complete with a UML class diagram and explanations of the Singleton pattern and object-oriented principles, also provided a good basis for understanding how the system would be built and how different components would relate to each other.

Process Reflection and Future Improvements:

Working through the design document helped drive the development of the code, most especially in visualizing the architecture and anticipating problems before actually coding. The structured approach helped identify critical components that would be essential for scaling and securing the application: the database layer and API communication. If I could revise one part of the documentation, it would be to extend the evaluation section to include more thorough comparisons of the various levels of platform compatibility, with particular emphasis on potential problems with mobile devices. It would be important to consider the user's requirements concerning device capability and performance in the design and testing of the mobile version of the game. Moving forward, I would pay more attention to having design documents include more user information, especially regarding user interface design and user experience since this is where the end-users will interact with the software.
